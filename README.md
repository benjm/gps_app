- This requires ruby 2.0. If you are using debian, this may require a third-party PPA. The package name is usually `ruby2.0`. Use `sudo update-alternatives --config ruby` to change the ruby version that `/usr/bin/ruby` points to in debian.
- Do `sudo gem install bundle` to install bundle (which installs ruby dependencies as described by Gemfile and Gemfile.lock)
- Do `bundle install` to install the dependencies of the Gemfile of the current project. These may fail to install if you don't have ruby 2.x.
